# Infinite monkey theorem

This script tests the infinite monkey theorem, which states  that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.

The script generates a random string of lowercase characters and punctuation and then compares it to the first word of shakespeare's play Hamlet. If the "monkey" types the word correctly, the correct word is added to a list and it moves to the second word etc.
